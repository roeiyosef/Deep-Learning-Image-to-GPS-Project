## 🚀 Live Demo
We have deployed our model to **Hugging Face Spaces**. You can upload any image from the BGU campus and get its predicted location on an interactive map.

## 📖 Overview
Standard GPS signals in dense urban environments (like university campuses) suffer from the **"Multipath Effect"**, causing deviations of 10-20 meters. This project proposes a robust **Visual Place Recognition (VPR)** system that regresses precise GPS coordinates from a single monocular image.

Our solution implements a novel **"Multi-Head Trinity Architecture"** based on a fine-tuned ResNet50 backbone. By simultaneously optimizing for **Coordinate Regression**, **Coarse Classification** (Smart Zones), and **Metric Learning** (Triplet Loss), we achieved a state-of-the-art mean localization error of **8.68m**.

## 📥 Data & Model Setup (Crucial Step)
Due to file size limits, the dataset and model weights are hosted on Google Drive. 
**You must download and place them correctly for the code to run.**

### 1. Download Model Weights
Required for `predict.py` and `check_submission.py`.

* **Download:** `best_model.pth`
* **Link:** [INSERT_LINK_TO_BEST_MODEL_PTH]
* **Action:** Place the file in the **root directory** of the project (next to `predict.py`).

### 2. Download Dataset
We provide two options. **Option A is recommended** for immediate reproduction of training.

#### 🟢 Option A: Preprocessed Data (Ready to Train)
This version includes the processed CSV with "Smart Zones" and corrected GPS labels.

* **Link:** [INSERT_LINK_TO_PROCESSED_DATA_ZIP]
* **Action:** 1. Download and unzip.
    2. Place the `images` folder inside `data/`.
    3. Place the `gt.csv` file inside `data/`.
    4. **Status:** You can run `python train.py` immediately.

#### 🟠 Option B: Raw Data (Submission Format)
This is the original dataset format as required by the submission guidelines.

* **Link:** [INSERT_LINK_TO_RAW_DATA_ZIP]
* **Action:**
    1. Download and unzip to `data/raw/`.
    2. **Preprocessing Required:** You must run the preprocessing script to generate the smart zones and handle GPS noise before training.
    ```bash
    python preprocess.py  # Generates the compatible gt.csv
    ```

**Final Directory Structure:**

## 🛠️ Environment SetupTo replicate our results, please strictly follow these steps to create a clean Conda environment with the required dependencies (including utm and pillow-heif).Bash# 1. Create a clean environment with Python 3.9
conda create -n gps_project python=3.9 -y

### 2. Activate the environment
conda activate gps_project

### 3. Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 4. Sanity Check (Optional)
python -c "import utm; import pillow_heif; print('✅ Setup Complete!')"

## 🧠 The "Trinity" ArchitectureThe model 
processes a 224x224 image through a ResNet50 backbone injected with Spatial Dropout layers, branching into three task-specific heads:Regression Head (MSE): Predicts the precise $(x, y)$ coordinates.Classification Head (Cross-Entropy): Classifies the image into one of 300 Smart Zones (generated via K-Means) to provide global context.Embedding Head (Triplet Loss): Learns a metric space where visually similar but geographically distant locations (aliasing) are pushed apart using Hard Negative Mining.🚀 How to Run1. TrainingTo train the model from scratch (ensure you followed "Data Setup Option A"):Bashpython train.py
Note: The script automatically handles weighted sampling, data loading, and validation checks.2. Inference (Evaluation)We provide a standalone function predict_gps that accepts a numpy array image and returns coordinates.Example usage (Python):Pythonimport numpy as np
from PIL import Image
from predict import predict_gps

### Load an image
img_path = "data/images/some_campus_image.jpg"
image = np.array(Image.open(img_path))

### Predict
Returns: np.array([latitude, longitude], dtype=float32)
coords = predict_gps(image)

print(f"Predicted Location: {coords}")
